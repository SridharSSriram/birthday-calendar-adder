# Birthday Calendar Adder

## I'm lazy.

I'm also an RA. As a result, I like to recognize my residents' birthdays whenever I can. However, instead of manually inputting my residents' birthdays into my calendar, I would MUCH rather write code to do that process with the help of the Google Calendar API. ((Because I'm lazy)).

## Setup

```python quickstart.py```
